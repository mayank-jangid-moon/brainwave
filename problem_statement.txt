In the age of rampant fake social media accounts, our project aims to develop an AI-driven solution to detect and eliminate fake profiles with high accuracy. By analyzing behavior patterns, profile metadata, and content, the model can distinguish between real and fake accounts in real time.

The Key Features of our project are Multi-Modal Analysis that Combines profile data (followers, engagement), Behavioral and Graph Analysis, that detects unusual patterns in interactions (comments, likes), identify clusters of suspicious accounts.

We aim at using Semi-Supervised Learning for detection of Fake Account in this case because of lack of labelled data available and a high cost of aquisition and labelling. We have a small amount of labelled data and we acquire the remaining large amount of data using web scraping and various tools.
